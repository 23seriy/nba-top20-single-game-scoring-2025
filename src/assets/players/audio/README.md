## Narration Content Suggestions

Each 1-minute narration should cover:
- **Player background** (10-15 seconds): Career highlights, playing style
- **Game context** (15-20 seconds): Opponent, venue, season situation
- **Performance breakdown** (20-25 seconds): How the points were scored, key moments
- **Historical significance** (10-15 seconds): Records broken, impact on NBA history

## Usage Notes
- Audio will play as background narration during the video footage for each player
- Files should be optimized for web playback
- If an audio file is missing, the video will play without narration
- Audio should be clear, professional quality suitable for sports content
- Multiple audio files for the same player (like Wilt Chamberlain) tell different stories for each performance
- **Dynamic Duration**: For rank 15 (Wilt Chamberlain 70 points), the video will automatically adjust to match the exact length of the audio file
